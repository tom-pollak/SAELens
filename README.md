# MATS SAE Training
This is a quick-and-dirty codebase for training SAEs that we put together
so MATS 5.0 Scholars under Neel Nanda could do cool projects in their research sprint.
It prioritizes development speed over having an intelligent structure.
If you want something that's better structured (but wasn't yet ready when we were making this), check out [this repo](https://github.com/ai-safety-foundation/sparse_autoencoder).

Lots of this code also copies from [Arthur's repo](https://github.com/ArthurConmy/sae).

## Set Up

```

conda create --name mats_sae_training python=3.11
conda activate mats_sae_training
pip install requirements.txt

```
